The source code for the LitTok website. Due to the low attention span of Gen Z, we decided to make this absolutely cursed application, to help them read books ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Yes,
this is a TikTok clone... for reading ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## TODO
More info soon.

## Developing and building the project
The project is a classic multipage application that uses standard HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript, more information can be found 
on the [wiki](https://github.com/MadLadSquad/LitTok/wiki/) or on the 
[MadLadSquad site](https://madladsquad.com/docs/LitTok/Home).
